The laws of probability indicate that if you left some monkeys in a room with some type-
writers for long enough, eventually they would reproduce Shakespeare. This assignment
asks you to write a program that tries to speed up the process. Instead of producing an
output text in which each character is chosen independently and totally at random, the
program tries to “learn” from an input text about which sequences of characters are likely
to occur in English.
This assignment is intended to give you experience with implementing the Map ADT
(entries are (key, value) pairs, keys must be unique, unordered) with both a binary search
tree and a hash table.
Simple Case.
First, suppose you want to implement a simple version of this program that just mimics
the distribution of the 26 lower-case letters of the English alphabet and the space character
in the input text.
• Scan through the input text, keeping track of how many times each character occurs.
During this process, you will update a CharDistribution object using a function
called occurs(c) that will increment a counter for character c every time c occurs.
So a CharDistribution object is implemented with a vector of 27 counters.
• After the distribution has been initialized in this way, you can obtain characters from
the CharDistribution object using a function getRandomChar(). This function will
return a character chosen randomly with the appropriate frequency. For example,
if the input text has 100 characters and the letter "a" appears 20 times, then the
probability that the function returns "a" should be .2 (i.e., 20%).
• Here is one way to implement getRandomChar(): choose a number at random
between 1 and the size of the input text, such that each number has equal probability
of being chosen. Then scan through the vector of counters, keeping a cumulative
sum of character occurrences. When the sum exceeds the random number, return
the associated character. (You may use a different method if you prefer.)
• To generate the output text for the simple case, call getRandomChar() the required
number of times, after initializing the CharDistribution object on the input text.
General Case.
The simple case described above generates a series of characters in which each individual
character occurs with the same frequency as it does in the input text. However, the

combinations of characters will not reflect the input text (i.e., will not be plausible
English). To capture the frequency with which different character combinations occur, we
need to alter this approach.
• When scanning the input text, you must create several different CharDistribution
objects. The number of CharDistribution objects depends on the window size w
provided as input to your program. First, suppose w = 1. Then we will need 27
different character distributions: the first one records the frequency with which
different characters follow "a" in the input text; the second one records the frequency
with which different characters follow "b" in the input text; etc.
• In general, when the window size is w, potentially 27w different character distribu-
tions are needed: one that records the frequency with which different characters
follow "aaa...a"; one that records the frequency with which different characters
follow "aaa...b"; etc.
• Although 27w is huge even for relatively small values of w, almost all of these
distributions are not needed! For instance, it is extremely unlikely that "aaa...a"
will occur in the input text, and if it does not occur, then the distribution of characters
following "aaa...a" is not needed.
• We will keep the different distribution objects in a map data structure, where the
key for each distribution object is the window that it corresponds to (e.g., "aaa")
and the value is the CharDistribution object itself.
• After scanning the input text, creating the different CharDistribution objects and
storing them in a map, the output text is generated as follows:
1: the first w characters of the output are the first w characters of the input text
2: while output has not reached desired length do
3: let the window be the last w characters that have been generated
4: use the window as the key to search the map and obtain a character distri-
bution
5: call the getRandomChar function for that distribution to get the next character
to be generated
6: end while
Map ADT.
The Map ADT usually has the following operations defined for an instance M:
• Size( ): Return the number of elements in M.
• Empty( ): Return true if M is empty and false otherwise.
• Find(k): If M contains an element e = (k, v) with a key k, then return a pointer or
reference to that element, otherwise return a null pointer or reference.
• Insert(k, v): If M does not have an element e with key equal to k, then add element
e to M, otherwise replace the value of element e with v; return a pointer or reference
to the inserted or modified element.

• Remove(k): Remove from M the element e with key equal to k; an error condition
occurs if M has no such element.
You will create two different implementations of the Map ADT, each containing, at a
minimum, the operations listed above. You can modify the arguments of the operations
to suit your needs.
• Implement a map data structure using a binary search tree. Compare the keys
lexicographically. Implementing as a balanced binary search tree will be 20 extra
points.
• Implement a map data structure using a hash table with separate chaining. You’ll
have to experiment to find a good hash function and table size.
Instructions.
Implement your map data structures as described in the sections General Case and Map
ADT located above.
You will turn in a zip file containing two programs: one implementing a map using a
binary search tree and the other using a hash table. Each main program should do the
following:
• Use the file merchant.txt as the input; it is Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice
with only lower case letters and spaces.
• Prompt the user for a positive integer, the window size, which, as described above,
affects how the program calculates its output text.
• Prompt the user for a positive integer, the length, in characters, of the output text.
• Write to a text file an output text of the specified length, as described in the section
General Case.
• One version of the program will use the binary search tree implementation for
the map and a second version will use the hash table implementation for the
map. The only changes allowed between the two versions of main is the choice of
map implementation. That is, you should have proper data abstraction, where the
implementation of the map is irrelevant to the user of the map.
• Use good style and make sure to comment your code well. If you discuss the
problem with someone, write their name in your comments. If you implemented a
balanced binary tree, make sure to say so in a prominent location in the comments.
• Turn in your program using binary search trees as a one source code file titled
FILIPA2.java or FILIPA2.cpp, where FI is the first two letters of your first (given)
name and LI is the first two letters of your last (family) name, e.g., Andrew Nemec
→ ANNEPA2.cpp. Turn in the hash table program as one source code file similarly
titled FILIPA3.java or FILIPA3.cpp.
You may base your code on that in the textbook, but otherwise all code should be
your own. Do not use premade data structures!
